Project Requirements 

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:
- The sources of data that you will extract from.
- The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
- The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
- The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.#

# Project Report
At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:
- **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
- **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
- **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
